Porting bits from ath10k:

Based on linux-next commit id 76d164f582150fd0259ec0fcbc485470bcd8033e .

* pci/pcie - includes a lot of SoC futzing to do things like cold/warm reset, etc
* legacy interrupts require magic, check pci.c
* copy engine pipe config
* copy engine basics
* bmi
* .. at this point we should be able to load in firmware

Then:

* finish off copy engine bits
* htt
* wmi
* whatever missing pieces for tx/rx dma at this point (should've been done above, but..)
* send/recieve commands to firmware
* data!

Notes:

* ath10k has more than Peregrine 2.0 (QCA988x) support
* it supports newer firmware, but chances are peregrine support is only 10.1 / 10.2
* .. so don't cheat by hard-coding 10.1 or 10.2 APIs; we have to do this somewhat
  clean early on.
